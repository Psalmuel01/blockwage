# .env.example — BlockWage Frontend (Next.js)
#
# Copy this file to `.env.local` (for local development) or set these variables
# in your hosting provider (e.g., Vercel) environment variables.
#
# Notes:
# - Variables prefixed with NEXT_PUBLIC_ will be exposed to client-side code.
# - Do NOT put private keys or secrets here. Backend-private keys must live only on server-side.
# - If you deploy the backend separately, set NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL to the backend base URL.
# - If you don't yet have deployed contracts, leave contract addresses blank or point to your local Hardhat RPC.
#
# Usage (local dev):
#  cp .env.example .env.local
#  edit .env.local with your values
#
# Example values below are placeholders — replace with your own RPC endpoints and addresses.

# Public RPC to use for read-only provider (Defaults to local Hardhat if not provided)
NEXT_PUBLIC_RPC_URL=http://localhost:8545

# Frontend (public) URL where the app will be hosted (used for building absolute links)
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=http://localhost:3000

# Backend base URL that the frontend will call for server-side endpoints (simulate-facilitator, verify, health)
# Example: http://localhost:3000 OR https://your-backend.example.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:3000

# Contract addresses (set after deploying to Cronos testnet or to your local network)
# SalarySchedule contract address
NEXT_PUBLIC_SALARY_SCHEDULE=0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000

# PayrollVault contract address
NEXT_PUBLIC_PAYROLL_VAULT=0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000

# PaymentVerifier contract address
NEXT_PUBLIC_PAYMENT_VERIFIER=0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000

# Stablecoin token address used for payroll (devUSDC.e on Cronos testnet or local mock)
NEXT_PUBLIC_STABLECOIN=0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000

# Optional: base URL for employee claim endpoints (if different)
# By default the frontend hosts public claim pages at /employee/[address], and SCHEDULER should hit the backend or those pages.
NEXT_PUBLIC_EMPLOYEE_CLAIM_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000

# Optional: If you have a facilitator emulator URL for testing
NEXT_PUBLIC_FACILITATOR_EMULATOR_URL=http://localhost:8081

# Optional flags / toggles (for dev)
NEXT_PUBLIC_USE_LOCAL_SIMULATOR=true

# Local development: enable verbose debug logs in frontend (true/false)
NEXT_PUBLIC_DEBUG=false

# Vercel notes
#
# For deployment to Vercel:
# - Do NOT commit private keys to the frontend repo.
# - Set the same NEXT_PUBLIC_* environment variables in Vercel's Project Settings:
#     - NEXT_PUBLIC_RPC_URL
#     - NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL
#     - NEXT_PUBLIC_SALARY_SCHEDULE
#     - NEXT_PUBLIC_PAYROLL_VAULT
#     - NEXT_PUBLIC_PAYMENT_VERIFIER
#     - NEXT_PUBLIC_STABLECOIN
#
# If your backend is hosted separately and you want to proxy API paths on Vercel,
# you can add a `vercel.json` to configure rewrites. Example (create vercel.json at repo root):
#
# {
#   "rewrites": [
#     { "source": "/api/(.*)", "destination": "https://your-backend.example.com/api/$1" }
#   ]
# }
#
# OR set environment variables in Vercel and have frontend call the backend by its absolute URL.
#
###############################################################################
# Quick troubleshooting
# - If the frontend shows "not-configured" for the stablecoin or contract address,
#   ensure NEXT_PUBLIC_* env vars are set and the app was rebuilt (on Vercel you must redeploy after env changes).
#
# - For local Hardhat deployments, run Hardhat node on 8545 and update:
#     NEXT_PUBLIC_RPC_URL=http://localhost:8545
#   and set contract addresses to the deployed addresses from your Hardhat deploy script.
#
# - When using MetaMask / Cronos-compatible wallets:
#   * Make sure the wallet network matches NEXT_PUBLIC_RPC_URL (if using local RPC, configure wallet network accordingly).
